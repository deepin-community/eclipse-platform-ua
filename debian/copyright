 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
 TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
 BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be
    recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably
    derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a
    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
    work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in
    timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an
    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
 b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as
    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
    License.
 c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
    other transfer of ownership.
 d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that
    offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in
    addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,
    play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or
    expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer
    being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a
    performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
    organization that transmits the broadcast.
 f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms
    of this License including without limitation any production in the
    literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or
    form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,
    pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work
    of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a
    choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;
    a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
    lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
    expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
    art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
    relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the
    extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by
    a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise
    considered a literary or artistic work.
 g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
    respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
    Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
    violation.
 h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and
    to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or
    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital
    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that
    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a
    place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public
    by any means or process and the communication to the public of the
    performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to
    broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,
    sounds or images.
 i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a
    protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
    medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
 b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,
    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to
    clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made
    to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
    original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a
    modification could indicate "The original work has been modified.";
 c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated
    in Collections; and,
 d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 e. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
        reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
        exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
        exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
        of the rights granted under this License; and,
   iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
        collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the
        Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers
        voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in
 other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly
 granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made
 subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of
    the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
    recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
    Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and
    to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological
    measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
    Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
    the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
    incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection
    apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You
    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
    as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
    Section 4(b), as requested.
 b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or
    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the
    name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
    and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
    or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party
    or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
    extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;
    and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation,
    a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
    "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
    based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
    this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
    provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at
    a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing
    authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these
    credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
    other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
    use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
 c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or
    take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be
    prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor
    agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise
    of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to
    make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,
    as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the
    applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your
    right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)
    but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
 OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).
    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
    Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at
    any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
    withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
    required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
    License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as
    stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,
    the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
    the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
    by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
    the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
    enforceable.
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
    and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with
    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
 f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention
    for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
    September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright
    Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996
    and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).
    These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
    jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
    according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
    those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
    standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
    additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
    License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under
    applicable law.

License: CPL-1.0
  Common Public License - v 1.0
  .
  THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC
  LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
  CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
  .
  1. DEFINITIONS
  .
  "Contribution" means:
  .
  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation
    distributed under this Agreement, and
    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
  .
  i) changes to the Program, and
  .
  ii) additions to the Program;
  .
  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
    distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'
    from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor
    itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not
    include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of
    software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own
    license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.
  .
  "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
  .
  "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
  necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
  combined with the Program.
  .
  "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this
  Agreement.
  .
  "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
  including all Contributors.
  .
  2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
  .
  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
    reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
    distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
    such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
  .
  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
    Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
    Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
    transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
    object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
    Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by
    the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination
    to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply
    to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per
    se is licensed hereunder.
  .
  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to
    its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any
    Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
    intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor
    disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity
    based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a
    condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each
    Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other
    intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
    patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it
    is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing
    the Program.
  .
  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
    copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright
    license set forth in this Agreement.
  .
  3. REQUIREMENTS
  .
  A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
  its own license agreement, provided that:
  .
  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
  .
  b) its license agreement:
  .
  i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
    conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of
    title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of
    merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;
  .
  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
    damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
    damages, such as lost profits;
  .
  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by
    that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
  .
  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,
    and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through
    a medium customarily used for software exchange.
  .
  When the Program is made available in source code form:
  .
  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and
  .
  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.
  .
  Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained
  within the Program.
  .
  Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
  any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
  originator of the Contribution.
  .
  4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
  .
  Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
  respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
  intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
  includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
  which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
  a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
  Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
  every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
  and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
  actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
  extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
  connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
  offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
  relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
  to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
  Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor
  to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and
  any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
  participate in any such claim at its own expense.
  .
  For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
  offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
  Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
  related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
  Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
  Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
  Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
  requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
  Contributor must pay those damages.
  .
  5. NO WARRANTY
  .
  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
  "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
  IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
  NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
  Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
  and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise
  of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
  costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
  data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
  .
  6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
  .
  EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
  CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
  SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
  PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
  STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY
  WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
  GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
  .
  7. GENERAL
  .
  If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
  law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
  terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
  provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
  provision valid and enforceable.
  .
  If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to
  a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
  lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such
  Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation
  is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
  entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
  Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
  hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights
  granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
  filed.
  .
  All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
  comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
  not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
  such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
  Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
  reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement

License: EPL-2.0
 Eclipse Public License - v 2.0
 .
     THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE
     PUBLIC LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION
     OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
 .
 1. DEFINITIONS
 .
 "Contribution" means:
 .
   a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
      Distributed under this Agreement, and
 .
   b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
      i) changes to the Program, and
      ii) additions to the Program;
   where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
   and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
   "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
   such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
   Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
   are not Modified Works.
 .
 "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
 .
 "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
 are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
 or when combined with the Program.
 .
 "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
 Agreement.
 .
 "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
 or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
 .
 "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
 form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
 editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
 represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
 .
 "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
 results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
 contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
 in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified
 Works shall not include works that contain only declarations,
 interfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely
 in each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program
 or Modified Works thereof.
 .
 "Distribute" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available
 in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.
 .
 "Source Code" means the form of a Program preferred for making
 modifications, including but not limited to software source code,
 documentation source, and configuration files.
 .
 "Secondary License" means either the GNU General Public License,
 Version 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any
 exceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial
 Contributor.
 .
 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
 .
   a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
   license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
   publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
   Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
 .
   b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
   grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
   license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
   import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
   if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
   apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
   the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
   of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
   Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
   combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
   licensed hereunder.
 .
   c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
   licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
   provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
   patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
   Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
   brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
   property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
   rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
   assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
   property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
   patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
   Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
   before distributing the Program.
 .
   d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
   sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
   the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
 .
   e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
   Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
   those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
   receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
   (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
 .
 3. REQUIREMENTS
 .
 3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
 .
   a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
   accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
   the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
   is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
   obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
   used for software exchange; and
 .
   b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
   different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
      warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
      warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
      implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
      for a particular purpose;
 .
      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
      liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
      incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
 .
      iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
      in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
 .
      iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
      party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
      of this section 3.
 .
 3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
 .
   a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
   Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
   files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
   Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
   Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
   under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
 .
   b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
   the Program.
 .
 3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
 trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
 of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
 the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
 their own appropriate notices.
 .
 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
 .
 Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
 with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
 license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
 the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
 offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
 liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
 the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
 ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
 other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
 damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
 and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
 Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
 Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program
 in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
 apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged
 intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified
 Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in
 writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,
 and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any
 related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
 participate in any such claim at its own expense.
 .
 For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial
 product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial
 Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance
 claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance
 claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility
 alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to
 defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance
 claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
 pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay
 those damages.
 .
 5. NO WARRANTY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
 PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS"
 BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
 IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
 TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the
 appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all
 risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,
 including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,
 compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs
 or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
 .
 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
 .
 EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT
 PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS
 SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
 EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
 PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN
 CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)
 ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE
 EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE
 POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. GENERAL
 .
 If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further
 action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the
 minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
 If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
 Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software
 or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's
 rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such
 litigation is filed.
 .
 All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it
 fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this
 Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of
 time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's
 rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use
 and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
 However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses
 granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.
 .
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,
 but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and
 may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward
 reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of
 this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement
 Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation
 is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the
 responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate
 entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing
 version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be
 Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was
 received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,
 Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its
 Contributions) under the new version.
 .
 Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient
 receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any
 Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,
 estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted
 under this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
 to be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.
 No third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.
 .

 Secondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth
 in the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),

   Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A
   is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.
 .
